# olist-store-analysis

A college project of a Brazilian e-commerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store.

## challenges

Below are the challenges and conditions of the project by the college for developing it:

* Chose a dataset.

* Perform the data **cleaning** and **preparation** before your **visualisation** and explain your steps. Use at least three visualisations along with specific features to summarise the most important aspects of the data. If you use different visualisations (e.g., statistical graphs, special plots, interactive maps, etc) explain the difference with advantages and disadvantages between them.

* Describe an importance of clustering in the domain of unsupervised machine learning. Briefly explain the difference between **k-Means** and **k-Medoid** clusterings. Apply both methods to the chosen data set of your choice using machine learning models for the training and testing phases. Evaluate the modelling outcomes and develop at least two illustrations to highlight the similarities and contrasts.


* Discuss the concept and application of Time series analysis using machine learning modelling and what is the purpose of **The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test** in time series?

* Apply an appropriate **ARIMA** or **Exponential Smoothing** model to the chosen data. Check for the model adequacy.

* Make a few-step-ahead forecasts of the last 10 observations. Determine the forecast errors.

* Make a time series plot of the data, and further calculate and illustrate the sample **autocorrelation** and **partial autocorrelation** (PA). Is there significant autocorrelation in the chosen time series?

* Create a visualisation using **Plotly** with its functionalities to highlight anomalies/trends/patterns and use the necessary techniques to visualise the density of the data displayed.

* What is the purpose of a recommendation system for online retail business in machine learning? Briefly compare Content and Collaborative filtering.

* Apply **Collaborative filtering** model.Train and test machine learning models for the user-user and item-item collaborative filtering.

* Explain the meaning of **“correlation”** between the variables and use at least three visualisations (Heatmap, Scatter plot, Jointplot, etc) that show correlations in your dataset. Explain the effect of the colours in the graphs and justify your palette choice and scale.

* Perform Market Basket Analysis by using **Apriori** and **FP growth** algorithms. Can you express major divergence between these models? Compare and contrast the machine learning results obtained based on both algorithms.

* Can you associate the results? Briefly explain the connection between the
visualisation, the data and the models you performed.
